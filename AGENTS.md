## Cypress rules of engagement
- Prefer stable selectors over text-only or deeply nested CSS.
- Only raise `defaultCommandTimeout` for a test when evidence shows slow DOM; otherwise wait on specific conditions (`cy.intercept + cy.wait`, `should('be.visible')`).
- For hover menus (e.g., makeup subcategories), prefer `realHover()` then assert visibility.
- For external origins (`cy.origin`), avoid brittle text assertions that change often.

## Test data & auth
- Use `Cypress.env()` for secrets; never hardcode credentials.
- Clean cart/wishlist via existing custom commands before assertions.

## PR etiquette
- Keep diffs small; include a failing-before/passing-after note in the PR body.

## Codex auto-fix pipeline (CI)
- Trigger: on failure of `e2e + TestRail` (or manual dispatch).
- Scope: edit only `cypress/**`, `cypress.config.js`, `package.json`, and docs.
- Guardrails: â‰¤300 diff lines; no secrets; minimal diffs.
- Output: DRAFT PR with RCA + artifacts (diff patch, JUnit).
